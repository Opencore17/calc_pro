# calc_pro
## Info
An advanced calculator built to do multiple mathematical calculation types.
The program can currently solve quadratics and calculate functions as well as changing distance/speed/time.
There are both python and c++ versions.
C++ version is faster and available in executable format but Python version has the ability to use graphs.

## Python (calc_pro.py)
This version is slower than C++ but it can create graphs.
This version is recommended for when graphs are needed.
The Python version uses the Cmath library to do mathematic equations.
It also uses the matplotlib library to create graphic representations of the functions.
This was the original language that the program was built in.

## C++ (calc_pro.cpp, pro_calc_cpp)
This version can not create graphs like the python version but it is signifigantly faster.
This version is reccomended for more when speed is needed or ease of download.
The C++ version also uses the Cmath library to do equations.

## How to Use
This code is available for general use.
Both versions of the code may be downloaded.
The C++ version is also available in unix executable format.
