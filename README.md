# calc_pro
## Info
An advanced calculator built to do multiple mathematical calculation types.
The program can currently solve quadratics and calculate functions as well as changing distance/speed/time.
There are both python and c++ versions.
C++ version is faster but Python version uses graphs.

## Python (calc_pro.py, calc_pro_py.exe)
This version is slower than C++ but it can create graphs.
This version is recommended for everyday use.
The Python version uses the Cmath library to do mathematic equations.
It also uses the matplotlib library to create graphic representations of the functions.
This was the original language that the program was built in.

## C++ (calc_pro.cpp, calc_pro_cpp.exe)
This version can not create graphs like the python version but it is signifigantly faster.
This version is reccomended for more complex calculations where a graph is not needed.
The C++ version also uses the Cmath library to do equations.

## How to Use
This code is available for general use.
Either copy the code or use the .exe files available for each version.
