# calc_pro
An advanced calculator built to do multiple mathematical calculation types.
The program can currently solve quadratics and calculate functions as well as changing distance/speed/time.
There are both python and c++ versions.
C++ version is faster but Python version uses graphs.

# Python
The Python version uses the Cmath library to do mathematic equations.
It also uses the matplotlib library to create graphic representations of the functions.
